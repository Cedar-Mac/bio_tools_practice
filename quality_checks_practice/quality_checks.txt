### Stage 1
Download archive: SRR15712950 (microbiome genome from alder root nodules) from ncbi SRA database: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra

### Stage 2
Install the SRA toolkit into $HOME/local/bin/ and add to PATH
Check that fastq_dump works correctly following the setup from the SRA toolkit README: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit
Use fastq_dump --split-3 alder_nodules to split the archive into two files:
    alder_nodules_1.fastq
    alder_nodules_2.fastq
alder_nodules_1 is the forward reads, and alder_nodules_2 is the reverse reads.


### Stage 3
Create conda environment. Install fastqc application through conda channel bioconda.
Use fastqc to check the quality of the forward reads. 
%GC content has an additional peak, unexpected for the metagenome.
Adapter contamination is fairly high.

### Stage 4 
Trim illumina adapter sequences from sequences. Adapter forward and reverse reads in the file: TruSeq3-PE.fa
Crop to 220 reads.
    trimmomatic PE -phred64 -trimlog trimlog.txt -basein alder_nodule_1.fastq \
    -baseout alder_nodule_filtered.fastq CROP:220 ILLUMINACLIP:./TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10

### Stage 5
Check the quality of the trimmed forward read paired sequences and compare to the pre trimmed using fastqc


### Stage 6
Methods
In an effort to better understand the options for preprocessing DNA sequence data, we have implemented 
three bioinformatics tools: fastq_dump from the SRA-toolkit [1], fastqc [2], and trimmomatic [3]. These
tools have been used in combination in the following pipeline:
    1. Access data from the SRA database [1] and unpack the archive using fastq_dump.
    2. Gain a basic understanding of the quality of the reads in the sample data using fastqc [2].
    3. Trim the sequence read using trimmomatic, paying special attention to issues uncovered from the 
    quality check of fastqc.
    4. Check improvements in the quality of the reads after using ILLUMINACLIP to remove adapter sequences.

Results
After downloading the data and running a quality precheck we found the following issues in the read 
quality: %GC content has an additional peak, unexpected for the metagenome, and adapter contamination was
fairly high. 
    trimmomatic PE -phred64 -trimlog trimlog.txt -basein alder_nodule_1.fastq \
    -baseout alder_nodule_filtered.fastq CROP:220 ILLUMINACLIP:./TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10
Running the above trimmomatic command [3] helped to cut Illumina adapter sequences and the crop removed 
potential contamination at the end of each read and standardized read length. 
A final check of the paired forward read sequence after trimming revealed a substantial improvement in 
the quality of the reads, having removed only 87 reads.

Discussion
While the pipeline used for preprocessing of DNA sequence data will depend on the source of the read data,
many of the tools used in this pipeline will be crucial in understanding the quality of the read data, 
and making any necessary changes. Fastqc [2] provides a clear snapshot of read quality, and trimmomatic [3]
provides a highly flexible framework for trimming low quality reads as well as possible contamination from
other organisms or the machine adapter sequences.
